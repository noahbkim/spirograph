# Spirograph

A spirograph generator that takes advantage of the HTML 5 canvas and advanced CSS effects and selectors. A demonstration is available on my website at https://live.noahbkim.com/spirograph/.

## Todo

- Full screen, sliding dialog on right side
- Colors for lines, trace from all arm vertices
- Color based on velocity
- Prevent 0 velocity generation
- Shareable links and hex encoding for spirographs
